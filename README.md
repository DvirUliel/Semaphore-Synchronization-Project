# Semaphore Synchronization Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of semaphores to synchronize processes in a Unix-like operating system. It includes initializing semaphores, forking multiple child processes, and managing process synchronization to print numbers from 1 to 100 in a controlled sequence.

## Features
- **Semaphore Initialization**: Create and initialize a set of semaphores for system and application-level operations.
- **Process Forking**: Fork multiple child processes to perform synchronized tasks.
- **Controlled Execution**: Use semaphores to ensure that processes execute in a synchronized manner.
- **System Testing and Validation**: Perform comprehensive testing to identify and resolve critical issues.
- **Resource Cleanup**: Properly clean up semaphore resources after execution.
